**Tray** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that can be used to launch the app
on system startup and run it in the background, adding global hotkeys and a tray menu to
toggle window visibility and create quick notes from anywhere in your operating system.

## Configuration

| Launch on startup          | Open Obsidian automatically whenever you log into your computer.                                                                                                                                                                  | Disabled                       |
| Hide on launch             | Minimises Obsidian automatically whenever the app is launched. If the "Run in background" option is enabled, windows will be hidden to the system tray/menubar instead of minimised to the taskbar/dock.                          | Disabled                       |
| Run in background          | Hide the app and continue to run it in the background instead of quitting it when pressing the window close button or toggle focus hotkey.                                                                                        | Disabled                       |
| Hide taskbar icon          | Hides the window's icon from from the dock/taskbar. This may not work on Linux-based OSes.                                                                                                                                        | Disabled                       |
| Create tray icon           | Add an icon to your system tray/menubar to bring hidden Obsidian windows back into focus on click or force a full quit/relaunch of the app through the right-click menu.                                                          | Enabled                        |
| Tray icon image            | Set the image used by the tray/menubar icon. Recommended size: 16x16                                                                                                                                                              | ![](obsidian.png)              |
| Tray icon tooltip          | Set a title to identify the tray/menubar icon by. The `{{vault}}` placeholder will be replaced by the vault name.                                                                                                                 | `{{vault}} \| Obsidian`        |
| Toggle window focus hotkey | This hotkey is registered globally and will be detected even if Obsidian does not have keyboard focus. Format: [Electron accelerator](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/keyboard-shortcuts#accelerators)            | <kbd>CmdOrCtrl+Shift+Tab</kbd> |

The `Relaunch Obsidian` and `Close Vault` actions can be triggered from the tray/menubar context menu,
or with the in-app command palette (search for "Tray: Relaunch Obsidian" or "Tray: Close Vault").
Hotkeys can be assigned to the commands via Obsidian's built-in hotkey manager.
